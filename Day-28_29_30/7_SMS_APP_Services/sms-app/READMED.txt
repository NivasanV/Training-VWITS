----- Servce -----
    - Though react doesn't recommend any direct react structure
    - It is recommend to write a seperate file to dealing with data (local/REST)

---- Fragment ----
    - As we know that JSX must contain on parent element
    - To exactly do this react offers a special tag <Fragment></Fragment>
    - Benefit of this tag is it does not any additional element in the DOM

In JSX we cannot use class for applying JSX class as it is keyword in JavaScript
Instead we can use 'className'
Simillarly in JSX we cannot use for attribute as it is a keyword
Instead we must use 'htmlFor'
