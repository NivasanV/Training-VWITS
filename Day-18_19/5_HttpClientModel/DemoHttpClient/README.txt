----------Http Client Module-------------
    while working with real world application.
    data is always stored on server and client  your application will be interested in 
    fetching the data from server.
    In order to do this client application(Angular Application) must be able to
    make http call over the network.
    To Exactly do this angular provides HttpClientModule.
 
Steps to use HttpClientModule
    1.Provide http client provider.by making entry in app.config.ts file
    2.Inject HttpClient to specific  service class.
    3.Use appropriate method as per requirement.(http methods)

Note:
    -As on date we don't know how to build a server we will be using open-source free
    facke REST EndPoints
    -for this demo we will be using : https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos
    -Our job is also build a server for Student Managent System

Observable
    -http clients works on Observable Model
    -Observable are used for making asyncronous operation
    -asyncronous calls are non-blocking calls and hence they give
    better user experience
    -actual network call is not made unless Observable are subscribed
    -we can subscribe to Observable by calling subscribe() method
    -after calling the subscribe() method we get the response as and argument
    to subscribe() method which we have to retriev by writting => function
    with in subscribe argument
